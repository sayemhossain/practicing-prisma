# Learning Prisma 📚💾

Welcome to the Learning Prisma repository! This project is your hands-on guide to mastering Prisma, the modern database toolkit that simplifies and enhances database interactions for developers.

## About Prisma

Prisma is a powerful database toolkit designed to streamline database management, query building, and data modeling. It offers a range of features that make working with databases more efficient and developer-friendly:

- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):** Prisma's ORM allows you to interact with databases using familiar programming language constructs, abstracting away the complexities of raw SQL queries. 🌐

- **Type-Safe Query Builder:** With Prisma, you can construct complex database queries using auto-completion and type checking, reducing the risk of runtime errors and enhancing code reliability. 🛠️

- **Database Schema Management:** Define your database schema using a declarative syntax, making it the single source of truth for your data model. Prisma enables you to manage and evolve your database structure with ease. 📁

- **Data Migrations:** Prisma supports database migrations, allowing you to make changes to your schema while preserving existing data. This ensures a smooth transition when evolving your database. 🔄

- **Real-Time Data Sync (Prisma Client 2):** Prisma Client 2 introduces real-time data synchronization, enabling your application to receive updates from the database in real time. 🔄🕒
